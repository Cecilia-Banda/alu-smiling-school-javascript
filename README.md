# alu-smiling-school-javascript

In this project, I will finalize the previous project 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap and make some parts dynamic with Javascript (JQuery exactly).

I will reuse final files of 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap and update them.

I will also use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap/Javascript knowledges that you learned previously, in this trimester.
